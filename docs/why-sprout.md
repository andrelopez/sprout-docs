## Authors

As an author, your focus is on creating good content. We want to keep it so.

Sprout plugins provide a seamless, Craft-friendly user experience for content authors. We take care as we build our plugins to extend the Craft UI and reuse design components wherever possible so that using a Sprout Plugin will always look and feel like you are using Craft.

## Designers

There is nothing worse than finding a plugin that solves a problem you have and then not having the design control you need to implement the design you want. 

On the front-end, a key goal as we build our plugins is to give designers 100% control of any HTML code that a Sprout plugin outputs. You'll be able to customize form templates, email templates, lists, metadata, and more.

In the Control Panel, we provide options to rename our plugins, customize permissions, and customize your content model for multi-regional and multi-lingual websites so you can create a client-focused user experience that includes just the fields and sections that make sense for your users.

## Developers

As a developer, you're likely less interested in what a plugin can do and more interested in what it can't do. Your job often requires taking something that works in a general way and finding a way to make it work for specific project requirements.

Early on, we decided to keep each Sprout plugin focused on doing one thing really well. For example, Sprout Forms comes with Notification and Reporting functionality but the engine behind those features is not provided by Sprout Forms – it's driven by Sprout Email and Sprout Reports.

Allowing our plugins to do one thing really well and talk to one another when they need to helps us create a flexible, extensible developer experience. If you need Notification Emails but we don't offer a trigger for the specific event you need, no problem – you can extend Sprout Email to build your own. If you're building a form and Sprout Forms doesn't provide a field type you need? Again, no problem, you can extend Sprout Forms to build your own. 

With Sprout's custom components and flexible APIs you'll have control over customizing Form Fields, Form Templates, Email Templates, Mailers, Notification Events, List Types, Data Sources, Schema, Importers and more.

Whether you need to extend Sprout functionality in Craft or integrate with third-party systems, Sprout does it's best to give you the options you customize your projects to the specific requirements you've been given, without the need to reinvent the wheel. 

## Support & Training

While the plugin ecosystem can sometimes feel like the wild west, Sprout plugins are designed by a business for businesses. You can trust that we'll be here when you reach out for support. We're invested in Craft and we're in it for the long haul.
